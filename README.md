In total 852 neuron morphologies are incluced in this dataset in the format of .swc, collected from 10 different regions of human brain. 

The brain specimens were acquired from 19 human cases, of which 18 cases were obtained from surgical procedure in Beijing Tiantan Hospital and 1 case was obtained from a donated brain from Human Brain & Tissue Bank of National Clinical Research Centre for Neurological Disorders. All the cases were informed for consent and all procedures involving human tissue for research purposes were approved by the institutional review board of Beijing Tiantan Hospital. The morphologies of the single neurons were collected through intracellular injection and optical imaging. All morphologies were reconstructed via the terafly platform of the vaa3d software (www.vaa3d.org).
The detailed protocols are available at https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.29.514375.

The files are named in the format of 'neuronIndex_patientID_brainRegion.swc'
